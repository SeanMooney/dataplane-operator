= Building a custom `ansible-runner` image

[role="_abstract"]
You can override the default container image used by the `ansible-runner` execution environment with your own custom image when you need additional Ansible content for a custom service.

.Procedure

. Create a `Containerfile` that adds the custom content to the default image:
+
----
ifeval::["{build}" != "downstream"]
FROM quay.io/openstack-k8s-operators/openstack-ansibleee-runner:latest
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" == "downstream"]
FROM registry.redhat.io/rhosp-dev-preview/ee-openstack-ansible-ee-rhel9:0.1.3-5
endif::[]
COPY my_custom_role /usr/share/ansible/roles/my_custom_role
----

. Build and push the image to a container registry:
+
----
$ podman build -t quay.io/example_user/my_custom_image:latest .
$ podman push quay.io/example_user/my_custom_role:latest
----

. Specify your new container image as the image that the `ansible-runner` execution environment must use to add the additional Ansible content that your custom service requires, such as Ansible roles or modules:
+
----
apiVersion: dataplane.openstack.org/v1beta1
kind: OpenStackDataPlaneService
metadata:
  name: custom-service
spec:
  label: dataplane-deployment-custom-service
ifeval::["{build}" != "downstream"]
  openStackAnsibleEERunnerImage: quay.io/openstack-k8s-operators/openstack-ansibleee-runner:latest <1>
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" == "downstream"]
  openStackAnsibleEERunnerImage: registry.redhat.io/rhosp-dev-preview/ee-openstack-ansible-ee-rhel9:0.1.3-5 <1>
endif::[]
  playbookContents: |
----
+
<1> Your container image that the `ansible-runner` execution environment uses to execute Ansible.
