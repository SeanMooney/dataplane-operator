You can perform a minor update of your OpenStack data plane environment to keep
it updated with the latest packages and containers.

You must coordinate the minor update of the OpenStack data plane environment
with a minor update of the control plane. OVN containers on the data plane
nodes should not be updated until OVN containers on the control plane have been
updated.
